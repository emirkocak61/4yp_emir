# Anytree Motion Planner

## Description

This package is the motion planner package for the anymal robot equipped with a unitree arm. There are two types of planners implemented currently. One of the planners only use the kinematics of the problem while the other uses the dynamics as well. In order to use the any of the planners, you should change the include file in the action servers and that should be it. I tried to implement the base classes for both planners with same naming.
